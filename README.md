# Enterprise Network Topology – Cisco Packet Tracer Final Project

## Overview
This is my final networking project built in **Cisco Packet Tracer** for a fictional **clothing company**. It demonstrates the practical implementation of network design, IP addressing, switching, routing, VLAN segmentation, Wi-Fi configuration, and multiple topology types (bus, star, ring, mesh).

The design focuses on **real-world scenarios** like departmental scaling, security enforcement, DHCP usage, and DNS setup.

## 🧱 Departments Covered
- Designing Team 1 (Bus Topology)
- Designing Team 2 (Star Topology)
- Sales Team (Bus Topology)
- Accounting Team (Bus Topology)
- Management Team (Ring Topology)
- Security Team (Mesh Topology)
- Wi-Fi Access Zone

## 🗺️ Network Topologies Used
| Department       | Topology Type | Why Chosen |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Designing Team 1 | Bus           | Cheap, scalable for growing design team |
| Designing Team 2 | Star          | Easy maintenance and fault isolation |
| Sales & Accounting | Bus         | Designed for department expansion |
| Management       | Ring          | Minimal change expected, stable connection |
| Security         | Mesh          | Highly secure, redundant, and fast |
| Wi-Fi Zone       | Wireless      | For employees with laptops or mobile devices |
